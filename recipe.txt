DIRECTIONS:
1) Choose your favorite organic peanut butter (or almond, which the chef prefers). It's best if you can grind it yourself at the store.
2) Refrigerate the jam for at least 2 hours, as you want it to be nice and cold.
3) Spoon the peanut butter evenly on the bread. Spread it right up to the edge.
4) Sprinkle the sea salt on top of the peanut butter.
5) Spoon the berry jam onto the peanut butter. With the back of the spoon, evenly spread the jam across the sandwich to the edge.
6) Top it off and eat immediately. You don't want the bread going stale as it sits out.
